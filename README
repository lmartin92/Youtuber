I'm horrible at gitignore file and fixing which files are in git at the moment.
I'll fix it later on when I'm not busy actually coding this project, but fixing
issues.

The good part to this little issue is, if you like in my bin/Debug folder
is the Youtuber app (which you may try on a linux machine). It can now do
exported bookmark detection (as long as in ~/Documents), and import bookmarks
from Google Chrome (which basically means it finds the directory where 
Google Chrome stores its bookmarks and uses it). So bookmark away and download
youtube videos as you like. This project depends on youtube-dl and ffmpeg.
You can pretty much guess where you need to go from there to encode mp3s.
